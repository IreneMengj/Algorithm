<p class="p1">Pakistan's main opposition leader Imran Khan has greeted supporters outside his home, just hours after there were violent clashes as police tried to arrest him.</p>

<p>He addressed the crowd and took pictures with those gathered near his compound in the city of Lahore.</p>

<p>In one video, he can be seen wearing a gas mask. Police fired tear gas shells during clashes throughout the night.</p>

<p>One official told the BBC that the arrest operation had been paused.</p>

<p>Punjab Interim Information Minister Amir Mir said the court-ordered operation to detain Mr Khan was suspended on Wednesday to allow a cricket tournament to take place nearby, as the stand-off was causing major traffic disruption.

    He said the operation would likely continue after the final of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) on 19 March.</p>
